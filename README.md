# Policy Scanner

Policy Scanner is now part of [Forseti Security](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security)! Future development will continue as part of Forseti Security.

Policy Scanner keeps the policies in your organization's Cloud Platform
projects secure by:

1. Scanning Cloud Platform Projects in your organization
2. Alerting if scanned projects deviate from a known-good policy

Policy Scanner also allows you to create source-controlled repository of your
projects' desired policies, and get alerts every time a project's policy
doesn't match its intended value.
